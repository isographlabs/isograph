# Announce Isograph v0.3.0 and v0.3.1

We're super excited to announce the release of Isograph v0.3.0, and a follow-up v0.3.1! The amount of features we stuffed into these releases is just absolutely massive. So, buckle up, this is going to be a long post.

## Big picture

These releases improve the usability of Isograph for real-world projects. They include massive internal refactors that bring Isograph closer to a cross-platform world. And they include contributions from **five new developers**!

There's never been a better time to give Isograph a try! Reviews from early adopters are that Isograph provides a great user experience

Features like Relay-style pagination, fetch policies and `onComplete`/`onError` callbacks make

## Detailed release notes

In these two releases, you'll find:

### Support for Relay-style connection spec pagination

We've added a `useConnectionSpecPagination` hook that makes working with Relay-style connections a breeze. Check out [the GitHub demo](https://github.com/isographlabs/isograph/blob/9cb0ac6dbd383b1b21df5b0686273d0a02288c27/demos/github-demo/src/isograph-components/UserRepositoryList.tsx#L22) for an example of it in action!

### Fetch policies

APIs for fetching data, such as `useLazyReference` and `useImperativeReference`, now accept a fetch policy! Using a fetch policy, you can specify that you would like to unconditionally make a network request, to make it if there isn't enough data in the store to fulfill the entire query, or to not make the network request.

### Support for refining to a concrete type and unions

GraphQL unions and interfaces are now given special fields, `asConcreteType` fields, which are non-null if the union/interface has that concrete type. For example, you might select `asUser` on an object of type `Node`.

### `onComplete` and `onError` callbacks

APIs for fetching data, such as `useLazyReference` and `useImperativeReference`, also accept `onComplete` and `onError` callbacks. These give you the ability to execute a callback when a network request completes or errors out.

### We lifted the requirement that IDs are globally unique

Isograph no longer requires IDs to be globally unique. Instead, they only must be unique within a given typename!

### `link` field

Each object type has a magic `link` field, which acts as a pointer to that object. So, for example, in `node(id: "4") { asUser { link } }`, the `link` field would be `{ __typename: "User", __link: "4" }`.

### Compiler watch mode performance improvements

Our compiler watch mode is now more efficient, and reuses more intermediate results! This is just a taste of things to come â€” expect massive efficiency gains in the next release ðŸ˜ˆ.

### Massively improved docs

Our docs have been overhauled! This task will never be done, but there are some serious improvements there!

### A demo of using Isograph with Vite

Isograph can be used with any build framework, but so far, all of our demos have used NextJS. Now, we have a Vite demo!

### Other features

- There are numerous additional validations, such as that there are no undefined or unused variables. Variables are also typechecked.
- There are improved component prop types
- We log when an environment is created
- Additional Isograph config options:
  - You can use the `generated_file_header` option to specify a comment that the Isograph compiler should include in generated files. This can be used to disable auto-formatting, linting, etc.
  - The `module` option controls whether the Babel transform, when encountering entrypoints, will generate `require` calls or `import` statements.
  - The `include_file_extensions_in_import_statements` option controls whether generated files refer to other files with or without file extensions.
  - The `no_babel_transform` option can be set to true if you don't have the babel transform set up.
- Our demos now showcase proper error handling.
- Isograph now has a peer dependency on React 18 or 19, and is not pinned to a specific version of React.

### Bug fixes

- The component cache had a bug that involved components defined on interfaces and items of different types with identical IDs. (Remember, IDs are no longer required to be globally unique!)
- We fixed a long-standing issue in which errors during SSR caused infinite suspense, instead of showing an error fallback.

### Other internal improvements

- We cut down on re-renders by having Isograph re-use parts of the old read out value. To my knowledge, this is done in a cutting edge way: by using the reader AST, and is thus likely to be more performant than any other solution!
- We did a substantial refactor that prepares Isograph to be able to generate SQL, OpenAPI, or any other type of query!
- We added fixture tests for added stability.
