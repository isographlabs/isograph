# Backlog

## TODO before release

- Publish binary, release npm package that executes it
- Support schema extensions
- Schema extension support in parser
- Specify main mutation object

## Top QOL priorities

- Watch mode CLI
- eslint enforcement that resolvers are exported
- Expose compiler binary as `iso`.
- multiple errors printed (when validating resolvers)

## V2 release

- components and "realized" resolvers, as well as ways to invalidate them
  - they could also be lazily calculated
  - may require garbage collection
- iso overload in files
- cleanup types
- watch mode
- rethink iso syntax

## Feature backlog

- garbage collection
- fetch policies
- Unwraps (i.e. `!`) exist in the syntax, but are unused
- Isograph only parses a subset of GraphQL schema syntax
- Resolvers are re-calculated every time. They should be cached in the store.
- The store, etc. should be stored in context.
- Resolvers return opaque objects and cannot be selected into. They should be extended to also allow the return of IDs, which can they be selected into.
- Stateful resolvers?
  - This could be thought of as "realized" resolvers, which is to say there is overlap with better DevEx for components
- Subscriptions are not supported, and mutations are supported super inflexibly.
- Defer, etc.
- Refetchable queries.
- Pagination.
- Types for variables.
- Inferred types for iso literals via Typescript compiler plugin.
- typed IDs
- consider resolvers that return functions only read data when called, i.e. do not eagerly read. Consider whether this can be achieved with omitting a !, i.e. foo_resolver! returns TReadFromStore, foo_resolver returns a `ReadDataResult<TReadFromStore>`

## Cleanup backlog

- Typegen code is a mess
- JS code needs structure, etc.
- `HACK__merge_linked_fields` is indicative of the fact that merged linked fields should contain hashmaps of key => merged item, instead of vectors of merged items.
- Objects which do not have IDs should be merged into their parent object in the store.
- Remove the requirement that arguments and parameters have a terminal comma.
- IsographSchemaObject, etc. should not contain name: WithLocation<...>, but instead, be stored `WithLocation<T>`, and WithLocation should **not** have a span.
- Consider combining isoFetch and iso, as in `` iso`entrypoint Query.home_page`  `` or the like

## Known bugs

- If a useLazyReference commits then receives new props, it does not make a new network request.
- if mutation primary field has a non-existent type, we panic, this should be an error
  - this is because we add the fields before we call Schema::validate_and_construct, where the error would naturally be found.
- incorrect spans for errors e.g. "Message: The id field on "Pet" must be "ID!"."
