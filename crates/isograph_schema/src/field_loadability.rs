/// The eventual plan is to clean this model up. Instead, imperative fields will
/// need to be explicitly selected loadably. If they are not, they will be fetched
/// as an immediate follow-up request. Once we do this, there will always be one
/// source of truth for whether a field is fetched imperatively: the presence of the
/// @loadable directive.
