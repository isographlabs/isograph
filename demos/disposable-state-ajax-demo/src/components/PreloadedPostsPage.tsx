/**
 * Preloading demo
 *
 * In this demo, we imperatively (i.e. not during render) make two network requests:
 * - We fetch the list of posts during a useEffect.
 * - We fetch the list of comments for a post when one mouses over a button.
 *
 * This demonstrates good and bad patterns!
 *
 * > Since this is a regular ol' REST endpoint, there is no way to combine the
 * > network request for the list of posts and the network request for a post's
 * > author, so we ignore posts' authors here. The best we can manage is to lazily
 * > load the post's author, which is demonstrated in the
 * > [lazy loading demo](./LazyLoadPostsPage.tsx).
 *
 * # The good
 *
 * We prefetch the comments for a post when you mouse over a button.
 * This is great! We can start the network request as soon as the user has signaled
 * intent to load a resource.
 *
 * Note that this is verbose and boilerplatey! In practice, library authors can
 * and should hide away much of this complexity.
 *
 * # The bad
 *
 * We fetch the list of posts during a useEffect.
 *
 * Note that fetching during an effect is **bad** and **has worse performance
 * than lazily loading**. However, we do not have router integration in this
 * demonstration, so the best we can do at the root of a page is to lazy load.
 * A future demo may add router integration.
 *
 * # The ugly
 *
 * In order to preload the comments for a given page, one must write
 * a decent amount of boilerplate. Note that for most cases, a library can
 * hide much of this complexity and only require that the developer use
 * react-disposable-state directly for more complicated use cases.
 *
 * This boilerplate is intentionally left in this demo!
 *
 * # Terminology
 *
 * - Lazy: we are using "lazy" here how Relay uses lazy, meaning the fetch occurs
 *   during the initial render.
 * - Reader: a component which reads a PromiseWrapper, and can suspend,
 *   but which does not trigger any network requests when rendered.
 * - Wrapper: a component which renders a suspense boundary and a PrelaodedLoader
 *   child component. The PromiseWrapper expected by the child is loaded
 *   imperatively (i.e. in response to an event).
 *
 * # Network config
 *
 * The loading states pass by very quickly! When testing this page in Chrome,
 * you can see the loading states more clearly if you create a custom network
 * config with added latency.

/**
 * The PreloadedPostsWrapper component.
 * - It makes a network request in a useEffect. **This is strictly worse than
 *   making the network request lazily (i.e. during render)**.
 *   - The reason we are doing this is because we do not have router
 *     integration. A router should be making this API call for you, and passing
 *     the PromiseWrapper to the child component.
