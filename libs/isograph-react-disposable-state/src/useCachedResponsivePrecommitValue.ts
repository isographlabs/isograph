/**
 * useCachedResponsivePrecommitValue<T>
 * - Takes a mutable parent cache, a factory function, and an onCommit callback.
 * - Returns T before commit after every parent cache change, and null afterward.
 * - Calls onCommit with the ItemCleanupPair during commit after every parent cache change.
 * - The T from the render phase is only temporarily retained. It may have been
 *   disposed by the time of the commit. If so, this hook checks the parent cache
 *   for another T or creates one, and passes this T to onCommit.
 * - If the T returned during the last render is not the same as the one that
 *   is passed to onCommit, during the commit phase, it will schedule another render.
 *
 * Invariant: the returned T has not been disposed during the tick of the render.
 * The T passed to the onCommit callback has not been disposed when the onCommit
 * callback is called.
 *
 * Passing a different parentCache:
 * - Pre-commit, passing a different parentCache has the effect of "resetting" this
 *   hook's state to the new cache's state. For example, if you have a cache associated
 *   with a set of variables (e.g. {name: "Matthew"}), and pass in another cache
 *   (e.g. associated with {name: "James"}), which is empty, the hook will fill that
 *   new cache with the factory function.
 * - Post-commit, passing a different parentCache will reset hook to the pre-commit
 *   state. The cache will return T before commit, then fill the new cache with the
 *   factory function and return null afterwards.
 *
 * Passing a different factory:
 * - Passing a different factory has no effect, except when factory is called,
 *   which is when the parent cache is being filled, or during commit.
 *
 * Passing a different onCommit:
 * - Passing a different onCommit has no effect, except for during commit.
